The solution addresses the lifetime management issue using a strong reference to the object within a block. By retaining the object strongly until after the invocation is performed, we ensure that the object remains valid for the duration of the method call, eliminating the potential for the crash. This approach is essential to guarantee the safety and reliability of applications that use `NSInvocation` in multithreaded or asynchronous environments.
